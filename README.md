# Introduction
Hi! I'm Halim, a student in the **Software Maintenance and Evolution** course.
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.

- **Fun fact**: I love playing chess and story mode games in my free time.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in maintaining and evolving software.
